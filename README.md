# Team-Selection
Hello guys 
This is about splitting team using python 🤔
In a lot of companies they used to split the team with two or three leaders 👨‍🎓
Now in this project I have two leaders and 13 Employees 👨‍💻
So we need to split these 13 employees to two leaders 🎎
It is not even So one take 6 employees and another take 7 employees 👐
And the important thing is that in this program , we deal with that two or three employees were taken by both leaders🤦‍♂️ , So I made a loop to run the program again and again the employees are not taken by both but, taken by one 😎
I hope you like this , Please leave a star ✨
Thankyou ! 🙏
